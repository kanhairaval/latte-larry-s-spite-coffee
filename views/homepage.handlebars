  <p>Hi, I am Larry David. And I too, like you have been kept down by the man. Mocha Joe next door, served me cold coffee and claimed it was hot, served me stale, dry scone and seated me at a wobbly table. If that wasn't enough, when I raised my concerns he called me a liar and banned me from the store. Well, he will rue the day he banned me, cause I am back baby. I have opened a coffee shop next to his just to spite him and I will not rest until I put him out of business or until I lose interest whatever comes first. Enjoy a hot cup of spite while you are here won't you.</p>
